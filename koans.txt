Said Master Rojaa Veru: When a coin moves from one butter to another, that is
a transaction. What, then, is the form of one butter transacting?

A monk asked Master Karuparesu, "If I have a coin, what shall I do with it?"

Master Karuparesu replied, "Destroy it."

Regarding no-coiners, a monk once asked Master Gabin Anduresen this question:
are not no-coiners truly enlightened, since they have no attachment to a single
coin? Have they transcended even the blockchain?

Master Gabin instructed him thus: Go to the market, and purchase for me three
pounds of flax.

The monk did as instructed, and understood.
