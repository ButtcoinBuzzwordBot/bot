Said Master Rojaa Veru: When a coin moves from one butter to another, that is
a transaction. What, then, is the form of one butter transacting?

A monk asked Master Karuparesu, "If I have a coin, what shall I do with it?"

Master Karuparesu replied, "Destroy it."

Regarding no-coiners, a monk once asked Master Gabin Anduresen this question:
are not no-coiners truly enlightened, since they have no attachment to a single
coin? Have they transcended even the blockchain?

Master Gabin instructed him thus: Go to the market, and purchase for me three
pounds of flax.

The monk did as instructed, and understood.

Two butters were arguing about the price of Bitcoin fluctuating on their charts.

One said, "The value moves. 1 BTC != 1 BTC."

The other said, "The chart moves. Its value stays the same."

They argued back and forth but could not agree.

Hui-neng, the sixth patriarch, wisely said: "Gentlemen! It is not the value that
moves. It is not the chart that moves. It is your belief that moves."

The two butters were struck with awe.

Once Satoshi and Pai-chang were chatting online and they saw a chart of the price of
Bitcoin over the last month.

The Master then downvoted Pai-chang''s comment, and when Pai-chang cried out in pain,
Satoshi said, "1 BTC = 1 BTC."
