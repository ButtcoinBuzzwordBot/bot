Said Master Rojaa Veru: When a coin moves from one butter to another, that is
a transaction. What, then, is the form of one butter transacting?

Commentary: This koan emphasizes the subtle meditative nature of HODLing, not
as stagnation, but as an active form of economically mind-expanding activity
via transacting with the self-- a form of stillness that exists as circular
motion.

A monk asked Master Karuparesu, "If I have a coin, what shall I do with it?"

Master Karuparesu replied, "Destroy it."

Commentary: If you have a coin, you recognize its existence as a thing
distinct from yourself; you can only perceive it by merit of acknowledging its
separateness. By destroying it, you bring yourself closer to a state of unity
with the coin, and with anyone else who has done the same. Thus, the
blockchain becomes the true definition of oneness with all, as that which is
put upon it is eliminated until all is one within it.

Taken together, these two koans present a rough sketch of the initiate's path
toward enlightenment: the ignorant man transacts with coins; the neophyte
HODLs them; and the ascended master unlocks their true potential by burning
them.
